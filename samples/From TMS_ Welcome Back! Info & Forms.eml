Dear Tenafly Middle School Parents and Guardians, =20

Welcome to the 2022-2023 school year at TMS! Mr. Comey, Ms. Paz and I =
are looking forward to welcoming almost 900 students (888 as of today) =
and 140 staff members. We are excited to kick off a new school year =
filled with learning, socializing, and growth. School is the greatest =
place in the world and we are ready to make this an amazing year.=20

 <https://www.tenaflyschools.org/Page/15632> Please click here for the =
Welcome Back Packet with everything you=E2=80=99ll need to know to get =
ready for the upcoming school year.  =20

Students will be getting their schedules on the first day of school, =
September 6th!  Remember that the first day is a half day for students =
so that we can focus only on our 6th graders in the morning.  Seventh =
and eighth graders come in the afternoon. Lunch service will begin on =
the second day.=20

For all returning families, welcome back to Tenafly Middle School.  For =
all new families including new sixth graders (THS Class of 2029!) and =
new-to-Tenafly people, welcome to our wonderful school.  We are =
confident that in a few weeks you will feel the magic, spirit, and =
positive energy that make our school one of the best anywhere.

Some other things to consider and upcoming events=20

*	Drive Slowly and Safely when You are Near the School!!!
*	Review and update your settings for receiving  =
<https://www.tenaflyschools.org/Page/18385> Blackboard notifications.
*	Grade 6 Meet and Greet for students is August 30 at 10:00 AM.
*	New-to-Tenafly orientation is August 30 at 2:00 PM.
*	Back-to-School Night is September 1 at 6:30 PM.
*	Picture Day is September 23.
*	Schools are closed September 26 and 27 in observance of Rosh Hashanah.
*	The Club Fair for students will be held after school on September 29.
*	October 11 is a Professional Day for staff, no school for students.
*	October 12 is our 6th Grade Reach Out Trip.

*	Reach Out is now an extended day trip to Club Getaway in Kent, CT.
*	We leave TMS at 7:30 AM and return at 8:30 PM.
*	Team-building and meeting new friends are the goals for the day so =
that all of our students feel comfortable, safe and connected during the =
year-more information to come.

Call for Parent/Guardian Volunteers

This year, we are instituting a Parent/Guardian Support Team focused on =
building a positive climate and improving student behavior and use of =
language. After COVID, we need to help students rebuild and strengthen =
their filters. When one enters a public space, a filter should snap into =
place that changes how one behaves and speaks. Last year, we noticed =
that some of these filters were nonexistent. Students need our help to =
reinstall the school filter. With feedback and support from our parent =
community, we know this effort will be successful. Email Ms. Saxenian at =
 <mailto:lsaxenian@tenafly.k12.nj.us> lsaxenian@tenafly.k12.nj.us if you =
are interested in being on this team.
