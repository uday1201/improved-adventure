Dear THS Community,

I wanted to provide a quick update on the Tenafly High School Club Fair. =
Currently, THS has 26 clubs with paid stipends that are meeting. =
Although our volunteer-run clubs are not meeting at this time, I am =
hopeful that these clubs will resume soon. With this in mind, we plan to =
hold our club fair in mid-October, highlighting all active clubs. Thank =
you for your patience as we plan this highly-anticipated student =
activity.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or =
concerns.

Jim Morrison
Principal

Welcome to the 2022-2023 School Year


The excitement that comes with the start of a new school year hangs in =
the air! It was wonderful to see our classrooms and offices filled with =
activity on Opening Day 2022. Students and staff definitely brought the =
sunshine on an otherwise rainy day.

=20

A special shout out and thank you to our year-round staff who worked =
tirelessly over the summer to ensure that the start of the school year =
was as clean and smooth as possible. We appreciate all that you do!

=20

Based on your feedback, Let's Talk TPS will be moving to a bimonthly =
distribution. Our newsletter will still be sent mid-week and contain =
news from around and within all of our schools. We hope that this meets =
everyone's needs.

=20

On a personal note, I want to thank everyone who reached out to wish me =
and Dr. Mamman well as we each prepare to move on to our next adventure. =
Dr. Mamman will be with us through mid-October and I will be here until =
December 1, 2022. We remain committed to the forward progress of the =
district throughout our remaining time in Tenafly so that the transition =
to a new administration is as smooth as possible. Thank you for your =
continued support.

Yours in Education,

Welcome Back Teachers and Staff

Opening Day was filled with excitement, school pride, and planning for =
the new school year. Our staff was hard at work setting up classrooms, =
creating bulletin boards, and ensuring that everything was just right =
for our return to school.
 	  <https://rr.smore.com/e/4hvxk/uIcynj?__$u__> 	=20


Thank You For Lending a Hand

Our new staff received warm welcomes from throughout the district. =
Current staff helped our newest team members to settle in, including =
Smith Elementary's Nurse Rose who popped over to Mackay to help Nurse =
Sharon Saglimbene get ready for the new school year.

Neither Rain, Nor Snow...

A big shout out to our fabulous crossing guards who weathered the rain =
on our first day of school to get all of our students to and from our =
schools safely! We were very happy to see those yellow raincoats =
directing us on the safe route to school!

Safety First

 	  <https://rr.smore.com/e/4hvxk/3bZZkT?__$u__> 	=20
 	=20
With school back in session and all of our students and staff onsite, we =
remind everyone to keep a watchful eye for students running to cars or =
crossing streets. For our walking students, parents please plan a =
walking route with your student to ensure safe crossing at =
intersections. For a list of crossing guard locations, visit the  =
<https://rr.smore.com/e/4hvxk/w-4NkU?__$u__> Safety Reminders section on =
our website.=20


Please follow the car line drop off and pick up procedures for each =
school, and we ask for your patience as our new families learn the =
process. We encourage parents and students to leave with extra time and =
ask you to discuss with your children the importance of using sidewalks, =
staying away from work areas, and following the directions of adults.

Hello Tenafly parents,

The Tenafly Middle School cross-country team will be having its first =
practice tomorrow September 13th from 3pm-4pm. If the weather permits we =
will meet outside on the track. If it is raining more than a drizzle we =
will meet inside the old gym for attendance and have a shortened =
practice which will end at 3:30pm. If your child would like to =
participate on the team please be sure to have followed the registration =
process as it appears on the Tenafly athletic page also found at the =
following link:

https://www.tenaflyschools. =
<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=3Dhttps%3a%2f%2fwww.tenaflyschools=
.org%2fPage%2f15567&c=3DE,1,GxJyVxcqshQCEVA-qp5EtOvQBpA6fUMC1Bk16EsDSaZ74=
l7d2xyuLAX-s1cOzJWTODlPZP1WN5HZg-f0DPW1_FhFwriGX-246OSS9LjVbzLapEqGUw5bDZ=
DvZHA_&typo=3D1> org/Page/15567

PDFs of the requisite medical forms can also be found on that page. =
Please complete the medical forms as soon as possible and hand them into =
our new school nurse, Nurse Rueger. Following an approval from our =
school physician your child will be able to participate in practice. =
Until the forms are officially approved a student may not physically =
participate in practice but can attend and observe if they wish. =
Practices are held Tuesdays-Fridays from 3pm-4pm with most meets being =
Thursdays at 4:15pm. Once a student appears on my approved roster I will =
send out a more detailed practice/meet schedule. We are looking forward =
to a great new season as we look to build on our success of last year. =
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

With Tiger Pride,

Coach DeJoseph

also be found on that page. Please complete the medical forms as soon as =
possible and hand them into our new school nurse, Nurse Rueger. =
Following an approval from our school physician your child will be able =
to participate in practice. Until the forms are officially approved a =
student may not physically participate in practice but can attend and =
observe if they wish. Practices are held Tuesdays-Fridays from 3pm-4pm =
with most meets being Thursdays at 4:15pm. Once a student appears on my =
approved roster I will send out a more detailed practice/meet schedule. =
We are looking forward to a great new season as we look to build on our =
success of last year. Let me know if I can be of further =
assistance.</span></p>

Dear Tenafly Middle School Parents and Guardians, =20

Welcome to the 2022-2023 school year at TMS! Mr. Comey, Ms. Paz and I =
are looking forward to welcoming almost 900 students (888 as of today) =
and 140 staff members. We are excited to kick off a new school year =
filled with learning, socializing, and growth. School is the greatest =
place in the world and we are ready to make this an amazing year.=20

 <https://www.tenaflyschools.org/Page/15632> Please click here for the =
Welcome Back Packet with everything you=E2=80=99ll need to know to get =
ready for the upcoming school year.  =20

Students will be getting their schedules on the first day of school, =
September 6th!  Remember that the first day is a half day for students =
so that we can focus only on our 6th graders in the morning.  Seventh =
and eighth graders come in the afternoon. Lunch service will begin on =
the second day.=20

For all returning families, welcome back to Tenafly Middle School.  For =
all new families including new sixth graders (THS Class of 2029!) and =
new-to-Tenafly people, welcome to our wonderful school.  We are =
confident that in a few weeks you will feel the magic, spirit, and =
positive energy that make our school one of the best anywhere.

Some other things to consider and upcoming events=20

*	Drive Slowly and Safely when You are Near the School!!!
*	Review and update your settings for receiving  =
<https://www.tenaflyschools.org/Page/18385> Blackboard notifications.
*	Grade 6 Meet and Greet for students is August 30 at 10:00 AM.
*	New-to-Tenafly orientation is August 30 at 2:00 PM.
*	Back-to-School Night is September 1 at 6:30 PM.
*	Picture Day is September 23.
*	Schools are closed September 26 and 27 in observance of Rosh Hashanah.
*	The Club Fair for students will be held after school on September 29.
*	October 11 is a Professional Day for staff, no school for students.
*	October 12 is our 6th Grade Reach Out Trip.

*	Reach Out is now an extended day trip to Club Getaway in Kent, CT.
*	We leave TMS at 7:30 AM and return at 8:30 PM.
*	Team-building and meeting new friends are the goals for the day so =
that all of our students feel comfortable, safe and connected during the =
year-more information to come.

Call for Parent/Guardian Volunteers

This year, we are instituting a Parent/Guardian Support Team focused on =
building a positive climate and improving student behavior and use of =
language. After COVID, we need to help students rebuild and strengthen =
their filters. When one enters a public space, a filter should snap into =
place that changes how one behaves and speaks. Last year, we noticed =
that some of these filters were nonexistent. Students need our help to =
reinstall the school filter. With feedback and support from our parent =
community, we know this effort will be successful. Email Ms. Saxenian at =
 <mailto:lsaxenian@tenafly.k12.nj.us> lsaxenian@tenafly.k12.nj.us if you =
are interested in being on this team.
