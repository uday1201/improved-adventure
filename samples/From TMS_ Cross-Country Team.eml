Hello Tenafly parents,

The Tenafly Middle School cross-country team will be having its first =
practice tomorrow September 13th from 3pm-4pm. If the weather permits we =
will meet outside on the track. If it is raining more than a drizzle we =
will meet inside the old gym for attendance and have a shortened =
practice which will end at 3:30pm. If your child would like to =
participate on the team please be sure to have followed the registration =
process as it appears on the Tenafly athletic page also found at the =
following link:

https://www.tenaflyschools. =
<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=3Dhttps%3a%2f%2fwww.tenaflyschools=

DvZHA_&typo=3D1> org/Page/15567

PDFs of the requisite medical forms can also be found on that page. =
Please complete the medical forms as soon as possible and hand them into =
our new school nurse, Nurse Rueger. Following an approval from our =
school physician your child will be able to participate in practice. =
Until the forms are officially approved a student may not physically =
participate in practice but can attend and observe if they wish. =
Practices are held Tuesdays-Fridays from 3pm-4pm with most meets being =
Thursdays at 4:15pm. Once a student appears on my approved roster I will =
send out a more detailed practice/meet schedule. We are looking forward =
to a great new season as we look to build on our success of last year. =
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

With Tiger Pride,

Coach DeJoseph
