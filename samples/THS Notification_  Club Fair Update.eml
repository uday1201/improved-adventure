Dear THS Community,

I wanted to provide a quick update on the Tenafly High School Club Fair. =
Currently, THS has 26 clubs with paid stipends that are meeting. =
Although our volunteer-run clubs are not meeting at this time, I am =
hopeful that these clubs will resume soon. With this in mind, we plan to =
hold our club fair in mid-October, highlighting all active clubs. Thank =
you for your patience as we plan this highly-anticipated student =
activity.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or =
concerns.

Jim Morrison
Principal
